I would like to thank [@Jyaasa](http://jyaasa.com/) for organizing the [coderetreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/) workshop here in Nepal.

Feel free to review my code.
This the best I could do for now. I will try to keep improving myself.

You can see the output at https://coderetreat2019.netlify.com/

If you wish to start your life with a differently, just update the `intialBoard` array in `src/App.js` and send a pull request. A link with your version should appear shortly thanks to netlify :)
